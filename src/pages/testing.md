title: Senior Accessibility Program Manager
permalink: /resume.html
intro: Over the past few years, I have pivoted in my career from software
  engineering to accessibility program management. As Blackhawk Network’s first
  (and only) accessibility employee, I developed a comprehensive accessibility
  program that was implemented across the company globally. I would love the
  opportunity to do the same for your company.
